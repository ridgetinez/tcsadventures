<p>&quot;<em>There should be no such thing as boring mathematics.</em>&quot; Edsger Dijkstra.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>If 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty, you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself: &apos;Dijkstra would not have liked this&apos;, well that would be enough immortality for me.</em>&quot; Also Dijkstra.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-is-it-about-anyway">What is it about anyway?</h3>
<p>I wouldn&apos;t even call this a book. You&apos;d expect a coherent flow of logical ideas presented in an engaging manner from a book, whereas I can only hope that this collection of pages is at least engaging first,
informative at a close second. </p>
<p>The writing here is meant to bridge the gap in UNSW&apos;s Computer Science curriculum, being, an appreciation and practice of all things <em>not</em> coding. In this (not so) fine compendium of notes, you&apos;ll see my journey through a ton of theoretical CS courses being hodgepodged together in an effort to learn as much as I can. Along the way, I&apos;ll be writing my solution to problems, providing code in order to play around with concepts, detailing notes on the stuff
I find really mind-boggling and threading in little extensions to the material here and there. </p>
<p><strong>The courses/books I&apos;ll be attacking are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Harvard&apos;s CS121, <em>Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</em> by Boaz Barak</li>
<li>Carnegie Mellon&apos;s 15-312, <em>Foundations of Programming Languages</em> by Rob Harper</li>
<li><em>pending, given how I&apos;m going with the two above monsters of resources</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h3>
<p>When writing, I have this image of a first year UNSW CSE student who has just taken COMP1511 and
MATH1081, and is now wondering when on Earth COMP2521 is going to pick up in difficulty. (I&apos;ll save
you the trouble, never. COMP1511 was as gruesome as first year gets!) To delve deeper into this reader,
they either love math, or are indifferent, however can see the benefit. A constant is that you&apos;re
reasonably proficient in proofs, algorithmic thinking and familiar with all your relations, graphs and probability content from MATH1081. We&apos;ll be building on that MUCH more, and seeing that theory be put into practice in the domain of CS. If you&apos;re not this budding first year student, this book is also for you, as I suspect that you haven&apos;t taken many of the (very little) theory courses at UNSW.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can make this enjoyable, and challenging so that you can really come out of these notes
with an appreciation and skill for the mathematical tools used to reason about computation.</p>
<h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h3>
<p>I&apos;m Adrian! A second year UNSW CS student (as of writing this in 2018) who really just wants to understand the underpinnings of the field, and push my skills in this special subset of mathematics to the extreme, all while playing around with the concepts practically, by coding and experimenting with the consequences of the many theorems we&apos;ll be encountering. My grades are pretty good if you care about that, and if you want to reach out, send me an email! (it&apos;s my github username @gmail.com)</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
